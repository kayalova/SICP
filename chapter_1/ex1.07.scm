; If I understand these things right

; we use floating point instead of fixed point so we can hold very large and small numbers
; because of its convenient form of record
; 600 000 000 000 000 = 6 x 10^15
; 0.000 000 000 03 = 0.3 Ñ… 10^(-10)

; these numbers can be shown with a mantissa and an exponent.
; For 32 bits mantissa is given 23 bits and exponent is given 8 bits and the remaining bit is for sign
; A Mantissa holds the main digits and the exponent defines where the decimal point should be placed
; so there are limits for integer and fractional parts of a number

; when sqrt procedure takes too large number its guess refinement starts needing more significants for greater precision
; as for very small numbers we need greater precision than 0.001
